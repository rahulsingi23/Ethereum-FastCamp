# Learn. Level Up. Launch your Dapp.

The Hyperverse FastCamp is a series of mini boot camps designed to help Web2 developers start building for Web3 (Ethereum, Metis, and Flow) using the Hyperverse.

## Project Ideas for Ethereum Dapp

### DeFi

DF001: Create an application that uses our Tribes module to delegate where money should be distributed amongst a community (DAO). Members can open the app, navigate to this module, and use our module to display different categories for them to choose from. They can make their decision by joining a particular tribe. Members can also choose to leave that tribe and join another if they change their mind.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Asset Tooling

### GameFi

GF001: Create factions/groups (mage, alchemist, swordsman, etc.) within your own personal game for users to join. Our Tribes module allows you to customize your own groups within your game.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Create Factions

GF002: Integrate our Random Pick module to randomize components of your game! This can include character customization (appearance and specs) for unique and funky combinations. You can also use this module to allow your characters to join certain factions or groups at random if you’re unsure about which side to be on.
Smart Modules: Random Pick (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Customize Character

GF003: Create a decentralized game that relies entirely on chance. The game can be similar to that of dice or rock paper scissors - just add your own personal spin on it!
Smart Modules: Random Pick (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Randomized Game

### DAO

DA001: Build sub-communities within the DAO you’re starting or an active member in. With our Tribes module you can develop different groups and distribute different roles and responsibilities within them for a more optimized workflow. You can even get creative and add personalized art that represents your creators, developers, admins or any other figure within these working groups!
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum)
DappStarter: DAO Roles & Responsibilities

DA002: Maybe there’s a lot of decision making occurring in your DAO and no one has established the best method for collecting votes. Our Tribes module can create a fun and interactive way for your members to cast them! Each tribe can be transformed to represent an important decision that needs to be made where your members can then make their choice.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum), ERC720, ERC721
DappStarter: DAO Cast your Vote

### Developing

DE001: Are you planning on participating in another hackathon soon? Use our Tribes module to create developer roles to help your teammates divide and conquer different responsibilities so you can claim your next bounty. Choose whether or not you and your teammate want to help build the front-end application or get started writing the smart contract code.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Divide and Conquer

### NFTs

NF001: Have you ever wanted to create your own NFT marketplace where you can create and mint your tokens? Maybe you are even a part of a DAO that wants to create a token ecosystem within it where community members can be rewarded for their achievements and/or contributions. Or you can create NFTs to represent anything else of your choosing!
Smart Modules: Token Modules (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Token Marketplace

NF002:  I am interested in creating an NFT marketplace to create and mint NFTs.  The marketplace would allow the NFTs to be transfered to others.  The NFTs and metadata would be backed on a support like IPFS.  These NFTs would be similar to moments on NBA Topshot and college athletes could mint these moments in the marketplace that is created.

# Kristen/CuddleofDeath's Project ideas:

## 1. DF001 -or- DE001

I plan on using the tribes app to make my own set of 'tribes' for people to join; I am not sure on what my tribes will be called quite yet, but I will have them figured out soon :) I may take the DE001 approach with this, not 100% sure yet!

##2. NF001
With this idea, I plan on making a mintable membership card for a fake/example organization.

##3. GF003 - HI/LO (High/Low)
For this idea, I am interested in making a HI/LO style game with 50/50 odds. It could simply just be a hi/lo game, or I could try to also add a win/lose streak component, and see if I can set up an NFT mint from that component as well. Essentially, the user would play the hi/lo game as many times as they want, then, they could mint their result. I am not sure if there's enough time to implement the minting, but getting the hi/lo game built would be fun :)

I mentioned a few project ideas since the submission mentioned to write ALL project ideas here. I am looking forward to the next step!
